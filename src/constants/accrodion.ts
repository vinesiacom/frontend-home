    text: `Fine wine, like other tangible assets, tends to have a more predictable market value compared to volatile assets like stocks, bonds or crypto. The value of fine wines grows over time as it matures and becomes rarer, making it a relatively stable investment.

This quote sums it up perfectly: "Buying shares in a company is risky: management can fail, reputations can be damaged and competitors can disrupt its entire business model. 
Wine on the other hand is blissfully simple. Once bottled and reviewed by critics, you already know enough to significantly minimize your risk.`,

    title: "Resistant to inflation",
    text: `Tangible assets like fine wine, gold, and real estate have historically served as an effective hedge during inflation periods. Fine wine in particular often retains or increases its value as it is not directly tied to the value of currency. 

In addition, the demand for high-quality wines is global, which can protect against localized economic downturns or inflation. This worldwide market can help stabilize and potentially increase the value of fine wines.`,

    title: "Low correlation to traditional markets",
    text: `The performance of the wine market tends to be uncorrelated with traditional financial markets. 
Consider that fine wine has historically shown a correlation of 0.12 to the S&P500, which demonstrates an almost complete de-correlation to the stock market.
    
During the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent shocks like COVID-19 or at the start of the Ukraine war, while many asset classes experienced significant losses, the fine wine market remained relatively resilient.
Limited drawdowns and low volatility in years of crisis make it a very attractive asset class to diversify an investment portfolio.`

    text: "The concept of Peace of Mind is paramount in alleviating the fear associated with investing in rare and exquisite wines. Investing in vintage commodities, such as old cars or watches, begins with verifying authenticity. At Vinesia, we source our wines exclusively from winemakers, allowing us to guarantee 100% authentic provenance to our investors and collectors.How does it come to life?Upon the delivery of wines from the winemakers to our Luxembourg warehouse, a tamper-proof NFC tag is applied directly over the top of the bottle or across the lid of the case. Breaking this seal indicates that the bottle has been opened or tampered with. This NFC tag transmits a unique identifier to the blockchain (Polygon), serving as the wine's certificate of authenticity. This certificate remains valid for the bottle's lifetime, whether stored in our warehouse or after delivery.",
